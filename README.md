## Not a full working site
The site [dsmadz.github.io](https://dsmadz.github.io/) only contains a working index.html page.

## Site Info
This site is going to be a collection of all my family's old recipes and our new favorite recipes.
It is being created in the hopes my distant family will always have access to the recipes if they have been lost, don't have access to them or never recieved a copy to begin with.

The web page is set up using flexbox for the page layout and a css file for the page styling.
It was my last homework assignment for **CS-125H**.
